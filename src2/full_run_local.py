"""Single python script that runs the full training loop and INLP locally, decomposes the BERT embeddings and evaluates
the results"""

# Libraries


#####
# Load the data
# This should call a module that creates a special class for storing and processing the data


#####
# Pre-process the data
# This should call certain methods from the data object that perform the pre-processing


#####
# Run the INLP loop
# This should be a function call that is applied to the data and outputs projection matrices, projections, etc.


#####
# Define projection matrices and decompose embeddings
# This should be a function that takes in the results from the previous step and outputs new data representations


#####
# Run evaluation tasks on decomposed embeddings
# This should be a series of function calls that take various representations and tasks and output results
# results should be saved in a df that is returned or saved as a csv somewhere
